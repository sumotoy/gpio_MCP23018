# gpio_MCP23018

A complete library for Microchip MCP23018 http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22103a.pdf, a 16 port I/O GPIO with Interrupt, *open drain version* that works by using just 2 shared CPU pins by using I2C<br>
The library can be easily included in other libraries, has methods that let's you change ports values fastly and you can easily access chip register directly.<br>
This library has been extracted from my universal gpio_library and I will maintain separately.<br>
I have included several examples but a complete wiki and detailed images will be published soon.
